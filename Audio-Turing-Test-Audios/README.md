# üìö Audio Turing Test Audios

> A high‚Äëquality, multidimensional Chinese audio corpus generated from textual transcripts, designed to evaluate the human-likeness and naturalness of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems‚Äîthe ‚ÄúAudio Turing Test.‚Äù

## About Audio Turing Test (ATT)

ATT is an evaluation framework featuring a standardized human evaluation protocol and an accompanying dataset, addressing the lack of unified evaluation standards in TTS research. To enhance rapid iteration and evaluation, we trained the Auto-ATT model based on Qwen2-Audio-7B, enabling a model-as-a-judge evaluation on the ATT dataset. Full details and related resources are available in the [ATT Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4).

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes 104 "trap" audio clips for attentiveness checks during evaluations:

* **35 flawed synthetic audio clips:** intentionally synthesized to highlight obvious flaws and unnaturalness.
* **69 authentic human recordings:** genuine human speech, serving as control samples.

## How to Use This Dataset

1. **Evaluate:** Use our [Auto-ATT evaluation model](https://huggingface.co/Meituan/Auto-ATT) to score your own or existing TTS audio clips.
2. **Benchmark:** Compare your evaluation scores against these reference audio samples from top-performing TTS models described in our research paper and these "trap" audio clips.


## Data Format

Audio files are provided in high-quality `.wav` format.
